Each person should making small updates and adding commit messages with them in your repository in our Github organization so that your work is visible. Do this with Github desktop. Otherwise, it will appear you are not working, and you will fail to demonstrate your knowledge of the application development process, which is one of our course goals. Thus, even if you claim to be working on your own machine but fail to post updates in Github in our shared organization where the professor can see them, you will fail on this grading item. Each person should have committed at least 6 code changes of significant size (not just a spelling error fix for example). Each commit should include a comment that explains what you did. The comment must be specific (ie. not just Updated README.md but rather explain what your update was and why you did it briefly).

Also, you need to be tracking your progress on planned and emerging tasks in your projectroadmap.md document. I will look for changes in this document as signs of your progress. Using checkboxes, adding new tasks as they emerge, or adding “DONE” to mark done items all could count here.
